# Prefix

The prefix function of Amour allows you to change its prefix. This is optional of course and can be toggled.

### Usage:

;;prefix \[prefix \| off\]  
\[prefix\] Can include using:

* an integer such as 4
* a symbol, like $
* or whatever your heart desires! 

#### Example:

;;prefix alone gets the servers prefix.

![Get the server prefix.](../.gitbook/assets/prefix.png)

;;setprefix or ;;prefix sets a new prefix for the bot.

To disable your prefix, you can use \(yourprefix\)prefix off.

If you forgot your server prefix, you can ping Amour and it will tell you.
