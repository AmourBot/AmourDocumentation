# Prefix

The prefix function of Amour allows you to change its prefix. This is optional of course and can be toggled.

### Usage:

;;prefix \[prefix | off]\
\[prefix] Can include using:

* an integer such as 4
* a symbol, like $
* or whatever your heart desires!&#x20;

#### Example:

;;prefix alone gets the servers prefix.

![Get the server prefix.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-30 at 1.08.45 PM.png>)

;;setprefix or ;;prefix sets a new prefix for the bot.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-30 at 1.09.38 PM.png>)

To disable your prefix, you can use (yourprefix)prefix off.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-30 at 1.10.17 PM.png>)

If you forgot your server prefix, you can ping Amour and it will tell you.
