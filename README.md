### FAQ

#### What if I have questions and need further help?

* Please reach out to Bea\#0001 on Discord for priority replies. Additionally, you can join the [support server](https://discord.gg/g4p6UMj) and send a message in the help channel which will automatically alert us.
* If you are not in the support server or would like an alternative option, you may use ;;amourhelp in any guild and Amour will DM you so you can submit your request and contact the developers through the bot.
* Alternatively, you may tweet @amourdiscord or email bea@amourbot.com with your request.

#### Is my information safe? 

* Amour's databases only store guild IDs, balances, user IDs etc and not things such as your IP as that cannot be grabbed by Amour. Amour's database is only accessible by Bea and Bea is the only one who can access Amour's system on a secure VPS.
* To request deletion of your information, please email bea@amourbot.com or send Bea\#0001 a DM. Additionally, you may use the contact info by clicking [here](done.md#contact-information).

#### What is the uptime of Amour?

* As of present, Amour's uptime has been almost 99.9% with maintenance only every 2 weeks for 10 minutes. If an update to Amour's hosting software is sent to us, maintenance can take up to two hours to push the software update.

#### Do you have a source code link?

* No. Amour's code is almost entirely unique for most and the database is called for in a lot of files, therefore it would also be a security breach to share the code.

Thank you so much for supporting and using Amour!
